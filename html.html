      <p class = "paragraph;" style="background-color: rgba(73, 70, 70, 0.281);font-size: 45px; border-radius: 35px;text"  > Objective: Shiritori is a Japanese word game where players take turns saying words that begin with the final kana (or character) of the previous word.
   
     Word Selection: Players can only use nouns (or words that can be used as nouns) in the game.
      
      Word Validity: Words must be valid and not repeated. Additionally, conjugations or particles can't be used as standalone words.
      
      Time Limit: Optionally, a time limit can be set for each turn to add pressure and excitement to the game.
      
      Game Over: The game ends when a player cannot come up with a valid word within the time limit, repeats a word that has already been said, or uses a word that ends with "n" (ã‚“) in Japanese, as no words start with this character.
   
      Scoring: Points are typically awarded for each valid word played, and the player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.
